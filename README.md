Moment of Inertia of Rigid Body

Let us consider a rigid body rotating about an axis YYâ€™ as shown in
Fig. 1.1 with angular velocity 'w'. The rigid body can be assumed to
be a network of 'nâ€™ point masses my, ma, ..., m, each at a respective
distance of ry, rz, ..., rn from the axis of rotation.

The moment of inertia of mass my, is I; = mur?

Similarly, the moment of inertia of the rest of the particles of the body
are l= mar, Is = mary,
The total moment of inertia of the body about the given axis of

n= mara?

v
rotation is the sum of moment of inertia of individual particles. Fig. 11: A rigid body rotating

n

i=1
n
I= 3 mr? (12)

1=1

Thus, MI of a rigid body about an axis of rotation 1s the sum of the products of individual mass
with the respective square of their distances from the axis of rotation.
The mass of a real body 1s distributed continuously throughout the entire body, in which case
equation (1 2) 1s replaced by

1=|rdm
where, integration is taken over the whole body. To evaluate this integral, we have to represent
'r' and 'dmâ€™ in terms of same integration variable
We see from equation (1.2) that the moment of mertia of a body 1s proportional to mass and to
the distribution of the masses. If the masses are widely distributed, then Ml of the body will be
higher. The moment of inertia of a body always depends upon the choice of axis. It can have
different values even for the same object depending upon the position of the axis of rotation.

1.3 Radius of Gyration

It 1s defined as the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to a
pont where the entire mass of the body 1s supposed to be
concentrated such that the moment of inertia of the point about the
axis would be same as the moment of inertia of the whole body about
the same axis with actual distribution of the particles as shown in
Fig. 1.2. It is denoted by K. Thus, in terms of radius of gyration (K), the
Ml of a body of mass M 1s given as,

1=MK? (1.3)

But, we have from equation (1.1),

I= mr? + mar? + mary? + + mar,?

If all the particles have same mass

where, M = mn is the total mass of ngid body
Companng equations (1.3) and (1.4), we get,

TT. X23

Thus, the radius of gyration of a body about a given axis is equal to the
of the squares of the distances of the particles from the axis of ro
position of the rotational axis and distnbution of masses of the bod
metre (m)

1.11 Angular Momentum

It is the physical quantity possessed by a body which
undergoes rotational motion and 1s actually the
quantity of rotational motion contained in a body. It is
always defined with respect to an axis about which the
body is rotating

Mathematically, it 1s defined as the vector product of

the distance of the particle from the axis of rotation Fig. 142: Angular momentum of a particle

and its linear momentum. It is usually denoted by L
and is often known as moment of linear momentum

Thus, for a particle of constant mass, moving with linear velocity V and linear momentum

P = mV, the angular momentum of the particle (L) whose position vector is T from the axis of
rotation (origin) is given by

Consider a ngid body rotating with angular velocity w about an axis which is Perpend;cy
ar

the plane of paper and passing through it as shown in Fig 1.13. Consider a particle of the pb, lo
which 1s at P and which has mass my and is at a perpendicular distance ry, from the
rotation. The body is ngid and so all of its particles have same angular velocity (w)

If v, be the linear veloaty of particle my, then

linear momentum of my, (pr) = mv = Min @

By definition of angular momentum, the angular momentum of particle my is,

Ly =npEnmno
Li=mn'o

If rest of the body is made up of parucles of masses my, my, my, ..., my whose distance from the |
axis are ry, ry ry, In respectively, then angular momentum of each particles can be shown
be, mur? @ mary @. |, mara? w, respectively |
So, total angular momentum (L) = myn? @ + mer? @ + man? oF + mart

= (mr? + mar? + muni+y + mend) o

L = CZmri)w

Again, the quantity (Emr?) 1s the moment of inertia (I) of the body about the given

rotauon

L=lo

Thus, angular momentum 1s also defined as the product of moment of tnertia about

rotation and the angular velocity about the same axis

1.12 Relation between Angular Momentum and Torque

We have from the definition of angular momentum,

L=le (From equation 122)

Differentiating both sides with respect to time, we get,

about that aus 1s a constant

But. er = @ is the angular acceleration of the body

dL _ I . (1.24)
So. ar='Â¢
Also, the torque (1) needed to rotate the body about the given axis is. ~
1= la - (1.25)
Comparing equations (1.24) and (1.25), we get,
dL | (126)
dr

Thus, torque acting on a body is equal to the ume rate change of angular momentum. Thus is

analogous to the Newton's second law of motion which states the net force acting on a body is
equal to me rate change of hnear momentum
So, we can apparently say that equation (1.26) 1s the rotational form of Newton's Second Law of

motion

1.13 Principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum

We know, for a body rotating uniformly about an axis, the rate of change of angular momentum
1s equal to torque acting on the body about the axis, re,
LiL
TE de

If the body 1s isolated trom its surrounding, such that no external torques act on the body. ie.
dL
1 = 0, then we can write above equation as, Tr = 0

Integrating above equation, we get,

L = constant
This 1s known as the principle of conservation of angular momentum
The principle of conservahon of angular momentum states that, â€œany systent of rotating bodies
mist have constant total angular momentum provided there is no resultant torque on the systemâ€
Further, we know L = lw (Equation 1.22)
So, principle of conservation of angular momentum can also be represented as,

lw = constant
Thus, if the resultant external torque acting on a body 1s zero, then the product of moment of
inertia (1) of the body about an axis of rotation and angular velocity (w) about the same axis is
constant, re, if the angular velocity (w) increases, then MI must decrease and vice versa. In
either cases however, their product is constant in the absence of external torque

PERIODIC MOTION

2.1 Introduction

In our day to day experience, we are familiar with various kinds of motion which repeat
themselves over and over after a regular interval of time. For example, motion of planets
around sun, motion of strings in guitar or violin, motion of compressed or stretched spring,
swinging of pendulum in a pendulum clock, etc Such kmd of motion which repeats itself over
and over again after a regular repeating interval of time is called periodic motion. However, all
the types of motion mentioned above are not of similar nature The string of guitar and
swinging of pendulum execute simular motion but they differ from that of the planets

If the particle in the periodic motion moves back and forth, then the motion is called oscillatory
motion or vibrating motion. A particle undergoing such motion has a stable equilibrium
position called mean position. When it is displaced from this mean position, a force or torque
comes into play which tends to pull it back towards the mean position, whuch is called as
restoring force (or torque). This restoring force may arise due to gravity, elasticity, or may have
electrical origin. But, by the time particle reaches to mean position, it has gained some kinetic
energy so it overshoots to stop somewhere on the other side till the kinetic energy is completely
lost and it is again pulled back towards equilibrium position by the restoring force. In this way,

motion continues forever in the absence of dissipative forces (forces that tend to remove
mechanical energy from the system)

During such repeated motion, the particle covers equal displacement on either side of mean
position and 1s also called as bounded motion; the motion being confined within the defined
Lmut Since sines and cosines are only trigonometric ratios which are periodic as well as

bounded, the displacement of oscillating particle is usually expressed in terms of sines or
cosines or combination of both.

2.2 Simple Harmonic Motion

Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) 1s a particular kind of oscillatory motion in which the

restoring force is directly proportional to the Linear displacement of the particle from the
equilibrium position.

If x be the displacement of a particle from its mean position and F is the restoring force acting
on it, then,
Fe x
or, =- kx

(23)

where, k is proportionality constant known as force constant and negative sign indicates that
restoring force acts opposite to the displacement from mean position.

2.5 simple Pendulum

Â£2
A simple pendulum is a heavy point mass suspended by an incxtensible, weightless string ons
a rigid support. The point on the rigid support from where the pendulum is suspended is called
the point of suspension. The pendulum oscillates in a vertical plane about the point of
suspension.
Gince the point mass and the inextensibility of string are the ideal concepts; we define a simple
pendulum for practical purpose as, â€œa small heavy spherical bob suspended by a light and fine silk
thread * The distance between the point of suspension and centre of itv of spherical bob
defines the effective length of pendulum. BELVIL 8 Spheres
Let us consider a small bob of mass 'm' is suspended by a thread
from the rigid support XY as shown in Fig 25. Let A be the
equilibrium position of the pendulum Now, if the bob is
displaced by a small angle 6 to new position B and then released
it oscillates simple harmonically about the mean position A Sera
fixed path CAB
At position B, the bob is under the action of following forces.
(i) The component mg cos Â© of its weight (mg)

which balances the tension (T) on the string,

ie, mgcosO=T ... (216)
(i) The component mg sin 8 of its weight (mg)
which provides the restoring force
ie, F=-mgsin@ (217)

9.6 Mass-Spring System

EE

A system consisting of a mass attached to one end of the spring whose another end is fixed to a
ngid support consbtutes a mass-spring system. When force 1s applied to the spring sa as to
stretch or compress it and then released, the mass oscillates about mean position. Here we have
assumed that spring is massless, the vibration is within the elastic limits so that Hooke's law is
applicable and dissipative forces such as drag of air is absent.

vertical Mass-Spring System

It consists of a mass 'mâ€™ suspended by a light helical spring whose one end is fixed to a rigid
support such that the suspended mass performs oscillatory motion about mean position under

the effect of restoring force in a vertical plane

A A

Let us consider a spring of negligible mass and
length AB = Ls suspended from a ngid support
as shown m Fig 2.6. Let a mass 'mâ€™ is attached to
its free end such that an extension BC = | is
produced on it
A restoring force F comes into play and the
spring tries to regain its original length. So, from
Hooke's law, B
F=-ki eo (225)
where, k 1s a proportionality constant and the
negative sign shows that restoring force 1s
opposite to object's displacement
At this condition, ie, at position C, the spring-
mass system is in equilibrium condition. So the

and opposite to its weight mg

9.7 Forced and Damped Oscillation

The energy of an ideal oscillating system always remains constant. But a real oscillator almost always
lies in a resistive medium. Some part of the energy is dissipated in overcoming such resistive forces
so that energy continuously decreases and the oscillation eventually dies out Such esallations are
called damped oscillations. The displacement-time graph and energy-tme graph for such esallation
shown in Fig 27

(i) Displacement -tme graph

Fig 27: Damped oscillation
Everybody in this universe has a characteristic tendency to vibrate when external force 1s applied
The amplitude and frequency of vibration of the body depend on its shape, size, and the elastic
properties. This frequency of vibration is called natural frequency
When a body is displaced from its mean position, it vibrates under the action of restonng force. If
there are no resistive forces such as friction, viscous force, etc, the body keeps on vibrating with its
natural frequency at a constant amplitude. Such vibration is called free oscillanon or vibration. The
total mechanical energy of such vibranon 1s always conserved The displacement-nme graph and
energy time graph for such oscillahons are as shown in Fig 28

When external periodic force 1s applied continuously on a damped oscillator, it can have sustained
oscillations. If the energy provided by the external force 15 equal to the energy lost by dissipative

forces, then the oscillation continues with constant amplitude. Such oscillations are called forced
oscillations

It shows that, the frequency of osallation depends
on the effective length (I) of the pendulum at a
place. For a constant length, the frequency of
oscillation is constant, whatever distance the
pendulum is displaced from the mean position.
This tells us that, if the pendulum is forced with vibration of frequency of 07 Hz, the amplitude of
vibration of the pendulum 1s maximum. The variation of amplitude of vibration for a body when it is
given a gradually changing frequency, is shown in Fig. 29

where, fo = natural frequency

Consequences of Resonance

1 Soldiers are asked to break their marching steps while crossing a bridge. If the frequency of
walking steps of soldiers is equal to the natural frequency of vibration of the bridge. then the
amplitude of its vibration 1s very large. As a result. resonance occurs. In this situation, the

bridge suffers large extension and may cross the elastic limit and collapse.

the radio produces a clear sound. For example, if we set the FM radio at 100 MHz in Nepal, we

3. A music expert can produce the musical note that may be matched to the natural frequency of
oscillation of glass tumbler. In this condition, resonance occurs in the vibration of the glass and
it may break. Therefore, it is believed that one of the Nine â€˜Jewelsâ€™ of Emperor Akbar, widely
known as Tansen, the king of music, was able to break a glass by singing the appropriate note )

4. Resonance can cause great damage during an earthquake. If the natural frequency of a building

FLUID STATICS

3.1 Introduction

â€”â€”

intermolecular binding in fluids is caller than solids and greater than gases. They do not have
specific shape bike ngid body, but cn give the internal shape of vessel where it 1s kept in. The
intra-molecular binding nature of fluid can generate the surface energy which can be explained
in terms of surtace tension. Also, the fluid has the internal force that opposes its flow during the
motion, called the viscous force.

31.2 Fluid Statics

Fluid statics deals with the fluid at rest and it deals with the mechanical properties of fluid in
equilibrium situation. The term fluid incorporates both liquids and gases Since the solid body
has definite shape and size, the mechanics of solids is the mechanics of ngid body, which we
studied in previous chapters However, the fluids flow. and hence they show basically differen
in comparison with solids. Moreover, the mechanical behaviour of liquids and

gases are also different, as the gas is highly compressible and liquids are almost incompressible

In this chapter, we will discuss on those behaviour of fluids which are common to any flusg,

specifically, the properties of liquids and gases due to the vanation of pressure, density and
buoyancy in stahe condition.

1.3 Pressure

When a fluid is kept in a container, it exerts a force perpendicular to any surface in contact with
it. such as containers wall, bottom and anybody immersed into it. The force exerted by a fluid
on any surface in contact with it is called thrust of fluid The thrust exerted by a fluid (at resy
per unit area of the surface in contact with the fluid is called pressure. It 1s be noted tha
pressure is also provided by solid, but it is defined for the fluid in "flind staticsâ€ and â€œfluid
dynamicsâ€

The due to a fluid column when fluid is kept in a tall cylinder, is determined in terms
of depth from the surface We know,
F

P= (32)
for the thrust being provided by the weight of fluid, F = mg = Vpg
re, y = Volume of fluid above the point of interest,
p = density of fluid and V = Ah

co, F= Ahpg.
Using equation (3.3) tn equation (3.2), we get,

co, the pressure exerted by a fluid column at rest 1s proportional to (a) height of the flud
column (b) density of fluid
| Po represents the atmosphenc pressure, then the total pressure P at the bottom of the cylinder is

p=Po+ hpp
Here, P is called absolute pressure The excess pressure (P - Pp) 1s called gauge pressure
Gauge pressure = Absolute pressure - Atmospheric pressure

(35)

Units of Pressure
Sl unit of pressure is Nm? or pascal (Pa), 1 Nm? = 1 Pa

ii. Atmosphere. 1 atmosphere is the pressure exerted by 760 mm of Hg column
{at 0Â°C, 95Â° latitude and mean sea level)

1 atm = 760 mm of Hg = 101 Â« 10Â° Nm?
iw. Torncelli (torr) 1 torncelli pressure 1s equal to the 1 mm of Hg So. 1 torr = 1 mm of Hg

Bar: In meterology, the atmospher pressure is measured in bar and mullibar
1bar = 10Â° Nm? = 10Â° Fa

1 millibar = 10-* bar = 100 Pa
Relation:

1.01 Â» 105Pa = 1 atm = 1.01 bar = 760 torr
Note: Linits of bead pressure

The blood pressure is measured ws nm of Hg. When the heart contracts to its smallest size, the pumping is
intense and the pressure of blod flowing in major arteries is nearty 120 mm of Hg. This ts known as systelic

pressure. When the heart expands to its largest size, the blood pressure es nearly 80 mm of Hy. This is known
as diastolic pressure.

The buoyant force acts vertically upward through the centre of gravity of the displaced fluid.
This point 1s called the centre of buovancy. If the floating body has non-uniform density, the
centres of gravity and buoyancy do not comnade Thus may result un torque and then centre of
buoyancy shifts to a new position. The point at which the vertical ine passing through the new
centre of buovancy meets the line iubally jowung centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity is

3.8 Surface Tension

It t= our common experience that we sce many insects walking on
the surface of water. If we gently place a needle on the surface of
still water, the needle floats on its surface. There are so many other
examples in which the body whose density 1s greater than the
liquid are observed floating on its surface. The principle of flotation
\ells that, the body having density greater than liquid must sink sme.
into it. Do these examples really violate the pnnciple of flotation? If Fig 14: Need Boating on uy,
not. why do these materials float on Liquid surface?

If we clossly observe the surface of liquid, it behaves like an elastic stretched membrane
reality this property of liquid is responsible for holding the dense materials on its surface. Ty,
study of the force that produces force of reaction on the Liquid surface is termed as surfae,
tension.

3.9 Types of Intermolecular Forces
Cohesive Force and Adhesive Force

Two types of intermolecular forces are explained below

(ij Cohesive force: The force of attraction between the molecules of the same substance i
known as cohesive force or force of cohesion. The corresponding phenomenon is calleg
cohesion. Due to strong cohesive force among the molecules, solids have definite shape
Liquids and gases have low cohesive forces, so they flow. The force of cohesion 1s very
strong in solids, weak in liquids and extremely weak in gases. Among the liquids. mercury
has comparatively high cohesive force. Therefore, mercury does not wet the glass because
force of cohesion dominates the effects of force of adhesion bebween mercury and glass

(ii) Adhesive force: The force of attraction between the molecules of wo different substances is known
as adhesive force or force of adhesion. The corresponding phenomenon is called adhesion. Dye
to high adhesive force, ink sticks to paper while wnting. Water wets the wall of glas
container because the force of adhesion between water and glass 1s greater than the force of
cohesion between water molecules. Strong adhesion is shown by the matenals [ike cemeny,
glue etc

and dip it into a soap solution, a thin s0ap film is formed on the frame. If a wet endless

Fig. 3.10 (i). But when the film is pricked at the center, the loop is stretched outwards and
lakes a symmetrical circular shape. When the film is pricked. the liquid film outside of the
loop tries to occupy minimum surface area due 10 surface tension. So the loop is pulled
outward equally along its circumference by the outer liquid film as shown in Fig. 3.10 (if)

Factors Affecting the Surface Tension

{1} Temperature: The surface tension of liquid decreases on increasing temperature
Thereltore, the oil spreads on cold water but remains as a drop on hot water

(ii) Mixing impurities like soap: The surface tension of liquid decreases when impurities are
mixed in at Therefore, detergents and soap solutions are used to wash clothes. They

decrease the surface tension of water and results the greater wetting and hence

washing
power is increased

(iii) Mixing highly soluble contamination: A highly soluble substance like sodium chloride
increases the surface tension

Applications of Surface Tension

{iy Since the surface tension of oil is smaller than that of water, oil spreads on water. This
property is used Lo calm down the stormy waves in sea

(1) Lubricating oils and paints have low surface tension. So, they spread properly

{ily The surface tension of soap solution is low, so It can spread over large arca and the clothes
can be washed elfectively

(iv) The surface tension decreases with rise in lemperature So, hot soup spreads over the
tongue easily, hence (tis tastier than cold soup

3.13 Angle of Contact

The liquid surface 15 usually curved when itis in contact with a solid The particular shape that

it takes, depends on the relative strengths of cohesive and adhesive forces

{i} If adhesive force dominates the cohesive force, the free surface of the liquid is concave in

shape as shown in Fig 312i). This lgquid wets the solid

{iy If cohesive force dominates the adhesive force, the free surface of liquid is convex in shape

as shown in Fig 312 (0) This liquid does not wet the sold

{iii} I adhesive force is equal to the cohesive force. the free surface of the liquid is plane as

shown in Fig, 3.12 (iu)

As explained above, when a glass capillary tube is dipped in water, the water rises up in the

dipped in mercury, the mercury is depressed below the free surface of the liquid in the

container. This is true for all the liquids which do not wet the capillary tube

Consider a glass capillary tube of uniform and fine bore dipped vertically in a liquid which
wets the glass. As SOON as one end of the tube is dipped into the liquid such as water, it nses up
0 a certain height due to force of adhesion between the glass and the Liquid molecules. As the
adhesive force between the glass and Liquid dormunates the cohesive force among the molecules

Due to its tendency to contract the
liquid surface pulls the glass tube inwards all along the circle of contact. Let 'T" be the inward

and is inclined at an angle "8" with the wall of capillary tube. According to Newton's third law of

Consider two layers X and Y as shown in Fig 3.17.
The velocity of layer X 1s smaller than upper adjacent layer Y. The layer Â¥ tends to accelerate on
she surface of X while slow moving layer X tends to retard the fast moving layer Â¥. As a result, a
packward dragging tangential force F. called viscous drag
comes into play. which tends to oppose the relative motion

The scheme of liquid flow in a closed pipe is quite different than
above situation. In this condition, the speed of axial molecule is
maximum and the veloaty profile 1s parabolic as shown in

Variation of Viscosity with Temperature
i. Incase of liquid: When a liquid is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases and
intermolecular attractions become weaker. Hence, the coefficient of viscosity of a liquid
decreases with the increase in temperature. The coefficient of viscosity at temperature 87Â°C
is determined from Slotle's empirical formula (ie. experimental formula). The Slotle's
empirical formula to determine the coefficient of viscosity of a liquid is,
a= | Eos
N= 7560 + fio?
where, ng and ng are the coefficient of viscosity at 0Â°C and 0Â°C respectively and @ and fi are
constants.
il. In case of gas: Viscosity of gases is caused due to the diffusion of molecules from one

moving layer to another. But the rate of diffusion of a gas is directly proportional to the
square root of its absolute temperature. So, we can say that the viscosity of gas increases

with increase of temperature. ie, 1 = JT.

3,17 Terminal Velocity

â€”
Terminal veloaty is defined as the constant maximum velocity acquired
by a body while falling through a viscous fluid

Consider a body falling under gravity through a viscous fluid. As
the body descends in viscous fluid, the fluid molecules around â€”
the body also descend with the same velocity. Hence, viscous â€”

drag is produced due to the relative motion of the fluid molecules

around the solids which ulbmately oppose the moton of the a }
body. Since. the viscous force increases with increasing velocity, a ]

stage will come at which the weight of the body W, is anced. by ie
the sum of upthrust U and viscous force F.. At this stage, there is no net force on the body. The
body starts moving with constant velocity called termunal velocity. The termunal velocity of a
body moving in a viscous fluid 1s shown in Fig 3.20

Note: One may think Hurt the body may stop when downward force is balanced by upward force. but the reason of
motion of the body is that the bady is in motion while such condi ton is attained (Newton's first law of motion)

OF THEORETICAL CONCEPT

There are several causes of sinking or floating of a body on a Liquid Give reason in the following

(a) Does a ship sink more in nver Water of in sea water? Explain.

(b) Steel balls sink in water but don't sink in mercury. Why? .

{c) Insular, a heliom filled balloon nses up to a certain height and then stops rising, Why

. (a) The upthrust provided by the fluid depends on its weight displaced by a body. The density of se
waler is greater than the density of ver water, so the weight of displaced water for same volume
is greater for sea water than river water. Therefore, lesser volume of water is needed 10 Moat the
same ship in sea than in nver

{b) The upthrust provided by a liquid depends on its displaced weight Also, we know the weight of
a body depends on its density.
density of steel = 7800 kgm
density of water = 1000 kgm
density of mercury = 13600 kgm?

Obviously, the density of steel is smaller than the mercury but greater than water. Therefore, the
welght of same volume of mercury is greater than thal of steel. So steel balls float on mercury
Also, weight of same volume of steel is greater than that of water, hence it sinks

Fluid Statics [Chapter 3| 79

Â© The upthrust on a body due to a fluid depends on the weight of displaced fluid. In the lower
height. the atmesphenc pressure is high, so the balloon displaces the sufficient weight of air to
get the upthrust to Lit it up As it rises up, atmospheric pressure gradually decreases. So. the
amount of aur displaced by the same volume of ballaon is low. Hence the upthrust of air is not
sufficient to ft up the helium filled balloon. Hence it stops rising after a 0 height

(a) What are centre of buoyancy and meta-centre?

i why a sinking ship often tums over as it becomes immersed mn water?

a) The upward force acting on a body inmersed in a fluid is called buoyant force, and the

omena is called buoyancy The force of bug

Y acts throu, re of ty of the
displaced fluid which is called centre of buoyancy ancy gh the centre of gravin
when the centre of gravity of the body and the centre of buoyancy do not lie on same vertical
line, the two force. the weight (W) of the body and the upthrust (U) from a couple which

produces rotation. As the floating body is slightly displaced from the equilibrium position. the
centre of buoyancy shifts io a new position. The vertical line passing through the new centre of
puoyancy meets the wutial vertical line at a point which is called meta-centre.

(b) When the ship 1s floanng, the metacentre of the ship 1s above the centre of gravity. As a result,
the centre of gravity is raised above the meta-centre. The ship runs over due to the couple
formed by the weight and the buoyant force

There are several applications of surface tension in our daily life. Give reason for the following uses,

(3) Why is soap solution a beter cleansing agent than ordinary water?

(b) Antiseptics used in cuts and wounds of human flesh have low surface tension. Why?

(c) Hot soup is more tasty than a cold ane, why? ~~

(a) Soap is muxed with water to make the soap solution. With the addition of soap, the surface
tension of water decreases The decease in surface tension enhances the wetung and washing
power

{b) Antsephics have low surface tension so that it can spread over a large area over the wound and
aeniate the wound, which helps to grow the new tissue in place of infected tissue

(c) The surface tension of a quid decreases on heating. So, hot soup has lesser surface tension than
cold soup. Therefore, hot soup spreads over the tongue easily and the taste buds on tongue
receive the taste of soup. Hence, hot soup 1s more tasty than that of cold one.

Use the mechanism of capallary action to explain the following phenomena

(a) How is the nse of liquid affected, if the top of the capillary tube is closed?

{t) How does the cotton w ick in an oil-filled lamp keep on burning?

fc) Why is it difficult to introduce mercury in a fine capillary tube?

(a) As the baud nses in the capillary tube, the air gets compressed between the top end of the tube

and the quid meniscus. The compressed air opposes the rise of liquid due to surface tension.
The hquid nses till the two opposing forces just balance each other Hence, of the top end of the
capillary tube 1s closed, liquid mses to a smaller height.

[b) The narrow spaces between the threads of the wick serve as capillary tubes through which oil

keeps on nsing due to capillary action
c) The angle of contact between mercury and glass is obtuse (0 > 90%). Due to this, the mercury

descends in the glass so that it is difficult to introduce mercury in the glass capillary tube. Due to

this reason, the reading of mercury thermometer needs to be corrected
